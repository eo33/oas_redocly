/**
 * Styled components don't work correctly with SSR without a particular plugin. You can notice it in dev mode:
 * "Warning: Prop `className` did not match. Server: ... Client: ...".
 *
 * Before we tried to avoid this plugin by keeping same import order for server and client code.
 *
 * But we can't do it anymore on the server because we use static imports only in node for perf.
 * This makes the order of modules loading different.
 *
 * Let's use babel temporary because esbuild doesn't have any support for plugins that work with AST and there is
 * nothing better to do this styled transformation right now. Using regexp is too dangerous.
 *
 * Ideally, we will write a custom transformer using some fast language and compile it to WASM.
 * We can start from something like https://github.com/TomerAberbach/parse-imports
